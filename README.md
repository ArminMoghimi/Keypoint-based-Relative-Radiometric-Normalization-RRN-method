# Keypoint based Relative Radiometric Normalization (RRN) method (codes and dataset)

This repository includes a MATLAB codes and datasets used in our manuscript "[A. Moghimi, T. Celik, A. Mohammadzadeh, H. Kusetogullari, "A Comparative Analysis of Feature Point Detection and Matching Methods in Relative Radiometric Normalization"] for relative radiometric normalization (RRN) of unregistered bi-temporal multi-spectral images.  

## Overview
The MATLAB code implements the fully automatic relative radiometric normalization methods for unregistered satellite image pairs based on the different feature detector-descriptors, presented in our manuscript.
